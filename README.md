# Markowitz Portfolio Optimization
Modern portfolio theory was pioneered by Harry Markowitz in 1952 and led to him being awarded the Nobel Prize in Economics in 1990. The [original essay](http://www.performance-measurement.org/Markowitz1952.pdf) on portfolio selection has since inspired a multitude of researchers and analysts to develop theories on financial modelling and risk management. Seeking similar inspiration, I studied the classical portfolio optimization technique introduced by Markowitz and applied it to real world data.
